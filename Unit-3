we can make changes in floorplan like rightnow our input output pin is equidistant.
we can do this by opening current def file of runs folder to see the layout after placement.
Now open openlane configurations and open floorplan.tcl to view the IO Mode which is set at 1.i.e-equidistant.
now in openlane tab-give command-%set::env(FP_IO_MODE) 2
give command run_floorplan



we will git clone a repository as that git already contains doc.md file of inverter and pmos ,nmos,sky130 where nshort.lib,pshort.lib are sky130 files for that:-
to clone the git repo .....
after getting cloned 
open vsdstcelldesign folder from openlane
 Clone custom inverter standard cell design from github repository
# Change directory to openlane
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# Clone the repository with custom inverter design
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign

# Change into repository directory
cd vsdstdcelldesign

# Copy magic tech file to the repo directory for easy access
cp /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech .

# Check contents whether everything is present
ls

# Command to open custom inverter layout in magic
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &

To see the layers used in the building of inverter
image2

IT have cmos,nmos and the red line is the polysilicon,the source of pmos in connected to vdd and nmos to ground
ih the skywater pdk first layer is interconnct that is short, we can get the layer from the colour pellet in right 
we can green colour as ndiffusion and brown as pdiffusion
if we place our cursor and select the intersection of nmos and polysilicon region (green) and write %what in tckon.tcl we will know that it is nmos.

image3
similiarly for pmos 
image 
now to see if drain of nmos and pmos are connected or not press s three times on Y region
image
source of nmos need to be connected to gnd and pmos to vdd(check)
image
write about lef from given git diff
 git:-llx-lower left x value,lly to define the rectangle
