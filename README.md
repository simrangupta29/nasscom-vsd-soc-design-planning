### <h1 id="header-1_1_1">Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs</h1>
#### Difference between chip and package
>*The chip is the core component where the actual processing happens. The package is the external enclosure that facilitates the chipâ€™s use in electronic systems.Chip is the brain of the operation, while the package is the body that allows the brain to function in a practical and durable manner within electronic devices.

>*Packages are much larger than the chip itself and come in various forms, such as Dual In-line Package (DIP), Quad Flat Package (QFP), Ball Grid Array (BGA), etc. They are designed to provide a standardized way to connect the chip to the rest of the electronic system.
>*the connections from package is fed to the chip by WIRE BOUND method which is none other than basic wired connection.

#### Components 
(1) **Pads:** Pads are used to connect the internal circuitry of the chip to external circuits.Pads are used to send the signal inside the chip.</br>
(2) **Core:** The core is the heart of the chip, where the main processing or operational functions are performed. It contains the functional elements of the chip, such as the CPU, memory cells, logic gates, etc.</br>
(3) **Die:** The die encompasses the entire functional circuit and serves as the foundational piece that is packaged to create a usable component for electronic devices.</br>

#### RISC-V SOC
>* It consist of SRAM,SOC,ADC,DAC,SPI these all are called foundry IP's.All devices depends upon foundry where all chips are fabricated using deposition and lithography techniques and so on.

**Foundary:**  Foundry refers to a company or facility that specializes in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. It turns designs into physical chips. This includes photolithography, doping, etching, deposition, and other steps necessary to build the intricate structures of transistors and circuits on a silicon wafer.</br>

**Difference between macros and Foundry IPs:** FOUNDRY IP's are Intellectual Properties whereas MACROS are repeatable digital logic blocks.</br>
<b>Macros: </b>Optimized for general use within digital designs and may be reused across different projects and technologies.</br>
<b>Foundry IPs:</b> Optimized for specific foundry processes, ensuring they meet the process specifications and performance criteria of the foundry.</br>

### <h1 id="header-1_1_2">Introduction to RISC-V</h1>
<b> ABOUT RISC-V ARCHITECTURE </b>

>* RISC-V is an open, versatile instruction-set architecture supporting diverse implementations.</br>
RISC-V is the first widely accepted open-source RISC processor.</br>
It features a base integer ISA, optional extensions, 32/64-bit variants, IEEE-754 floating-point support, and facilitates experimentation with privileged architectures, hypervisors, and parallel computing.

#### Intruction Set Architecture
To implement a C program on a specific hardware layout.<br>
**Compilation to Assembly Language:** The C program is initially compiled into an assembly language program using the RISC-V ISA (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - V Instruction Set Architecture).
<br>

**Conversion to Machine Language:** The assembly language program is then converted into a machine language program, which is in binary (logic 0 and 1). This binary code is what the hardware of the computer understands.
<br>

**RTL Implementation:** After obtaining the machine language program, we need to implement the RISC-V specification using an RTL (Register-Transfer Level) hardware description language. For example, we can use picorv32, which is an open-source implementation of the RISC-V ISA.
<br>

**RTL to Layout Flow:** The RTL code is then processed through a standard PnR (Place and Route) flow, often referred to as RTL to GDSII (Graphic Data System II). This flow typically involves synthesis, placement, routing, and other steps to generate the physical layout of the chip.
<br>

### <h1 id="header-1_1_3">From Software Applications to Hardware</h1>

To run an application software on hardware, several processes take place involving both system software and hardware interaction. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of the process:

#### Application Software to Hardware Execution Flow
>* **1.Application Software Entry:-** The application software, written in a high-level language (e.g., C, C++, VB, or Java), enters the system software layer.

>* **2.System Software Components:-** The major components of system software involved in this process are the Operating System (OS), Compiler, and Assembler.

>* **3.Operating System (OS) Role:-** The OS manages the execution of application software and outputs small functions written in high-level languages (C, C++, VB, Java).
These functions are then handed over to the respective compiler.

>* **4.Compiler's Job:-** The compiler translates the high-level language code into assembly language instructions.
The syntax and structure of these instructions vary depending on the hardware architecture (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC-V) on which the system is implemented.
The output is often an executable file (.exe) that contains the compiled instructions.


>* **5.Assembler's Role:-** The assembler takes the assembly language instructions and converts them into binary format, known as machine language.
This machine language program is a sequence of binary codes (0s and 1s) that the hardware can understand.

>* **6.Binary Code Execution:-** The binary code is fed into the hardware, where it is executed. The hardware performs specific functions based on the binary instructions it receives.

![Screenshot (577)](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/c1dd5aa6-c5bb-4891-a8dc-986f89ef0026)

#### EXAMPLE
* Suppose we have a C function to stop a stopwatch. This function enters the system software layer.
* The OS outputs this C function, and the compiler converts it into assembly language instructions tailored for the RISC-V architecture.
* The assembler then translates these RISC-V assembly instructions into binary machine code.
* This binary code is loaded into the chip (hardware), where it controls the stopping of the stopwatch.

![Screenshot (578)](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/84210e79-b69d-4a65-9181-17cdac3062aa)

>* **1.Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):-** Instructions act as an abstract interface between the high-level language (C, C++) and the hardware.
In this case, the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines the instructions that the RISC-V hardware understands.

>* **2.Hardware Description Language (HDL) and RTL:-** To implement the RISC-V specifications on hardware, an HDL (e.g., Verilog) is used at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL).
The RTL code describes the hardware behavior.
>* The RTL code is then synthesized into a gate-level netlist, which describes the actual logic gates and connections required to perform the specified functions.
This netlist is used to fabricate the chip, ensuring the hardware performs the intended functions based on the binary instructions it receives.

## <h1 id="header-1_2">Soc design and OpenLANE</h1>
### <h1 id="header-1_2_1">Introduction to all components of open-source digital asic design</h1>

Designing an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) involves several critical steps and the use of various tools and components.They are as follows:-
* **1.RTL (Register-Transfer Level) IPs:-** RTL is a level of abstraction used in describing the behavior of a digital circuit. RTL IPs (Intellectual Properties) are pre-designed, reusable blocks of RTL code that perform specific functions (e.g., memory controllers, communication interfaces, processors).
Example: A picorv32 core, which is an RTL implementation of a RISC-V processor.

* **2.EDA tools:-** EDA tools are software tools used to design and verify electronic systems such as ICs. They include various types of tools for different stages of the design process like Design Entry Tools,simulation tools,synthesis tools.
* **3.PDK Data:-** PDK (Process Design Kit) is a set of files and documentation provided by a semiconductor foundry that describes the manufacturing process and contains the necessary data to design and fabricate chips using that process.
 It includes design rules, device models, standard cell libraries, IO libraries, and technology files.

### <h1 id="header-1_3_1">OpenLANE Directory structure in detail</h1>
Now we will do lab work so to do this.First we have to create virtual machine in Linux environment.<br>
OpenLANE leverages the OpenROAD tools and other open-source projects to facilitate the entire design process.
* The working directory in OpenLANE is where all the files related to a specific ASIC design project are organized and managed.
* Here we are working on  openlane_working_dir directory.
* **libs.ref**: Provides references to standard cell libraries and other component libraries needed for digital design stages such as synthesis, placement, and routing.
* **libs.tech:** Contains technology-specific rules and parameters needed for ensuring that the design adheres to manufacturing process capabilities and limitations.

```
> * The ./flow.tcl -interactive command is used to launch the OpenLANE ASIC design flow in interactive mode.Interactive mode allows you to run the design flow step-by-step, giving you control over each stage of the process. This is particularly useful for debugging, learning, and fine-tuning the design flow according to specific needs.
This command will start OpenLANE in interactive mode, presenting you with an OpenLANE prompt.


Now, If we are go into the design folder in openlane, there are nearly 30-40 designs are already built. Out of them we can open any of the design. for example, here we are opening the picorv32a.v design.
![SOC4](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/613842e1-e056-43c4-84fb-36a094283f9d)

<b> Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.</b>
> *The PicoRV32 is a minimalistic RISC-V CPU core, designed by Clifford Wolf. It is particularly suitable for use in FPGAs and ASICs due to its small size and configurability. The "picorv32a" variant refers to an area-optimized version of the PicoRV32 core. Here's an overview of the PicoRV32a design and its contents:

![SOC5](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/c8844d7a-9cb2-490a-9cdd-48b8f0e3a084)

It contains 3 files:-<br>
* **"src"**- It is where verilog files for our rtl netlist exists.src contains picorv32.v which is the  main Verilog file containing the RTL description of the PicoRV32 CPU core.

* **config.tcl**- Configuration files allow for the customization of the CPU core, enabling or disabling certain features to optimize for area, speed, or power consumption.
![SOC6](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/05a1a47f-6411-4f78-93e7-b196908c85d2)
 > The above figure shows the configuration of picorv32,showing design name ,clock period as 5.00,clock port etc.

Now In openlane, we are going to run the synthesis, but before synthesis, we have to include packages and prepare design setup stage. for that command is:-
```
% package require openlane 0.9
% prep -designs picorv32a
```
![SOC7](https://github.com/simrangupta29/nasscom-vsd-soc-design-planning/assets/130252328/77cab21f-c749-45d3-b8d2-8e6075d9ecc2)
> The preparation is completed.In this lib.ref and lib.tech got merged.

### <h1 id="header-1_3_3">Review files after design prep and run synthesis</h1>
After completing the preparation, in the picorv32a file, the run directory is created. Inside the folder, Today's date is created. so in this directory some folders are available which is required for openlane.<br>
